# Hexahedron Land
A procedurally generated voxel world with biomes. (Work in progress)

## Features
- An infinite procedurally generated world.
- Terrain generation with Simplex Noise layered into Fractional Brownian Motion.
- Chunk based voxel system.
- 16 distinct biomes based on levels of temperature and precipitation.
- Domain warping for more realistic landscapes.
- Asynchronous, parallel, and burst compiled code for increased performance.

## Planned Features
- GPU instanced foliage.
- Compute shader for generating Simplex Noise.
- Object pool for chunks.
- Easing functions for terrain generation.
- Curved world.
- Underground cave system.
